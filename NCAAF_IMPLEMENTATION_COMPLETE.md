# NCAAF Correlation Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary
NCAAF correlations are now fully implemented! The system uses QB Pass Yards as the single anchor, which correlates with BOTH Receiver Rec Yards AND Receiver Receptions.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (All Complete)
1. **splash_scraper.py** - Collects `passing_yards`, `receiving_yards`, and `receiving_receptions` for NCAAF
2. **config.py** - NCAAF markets include all three prop types
3. **football_correlation_rules.py** - Added correlations:
   - QB Pass Yards → Receiver Rec Yards (0.70/0.55/0.40/0.50/0.35 based on position)
   - QB Pass Yards → Receiver Receptions (0.60 for all positions)
4. **qb_anchored_parlays.py** - Properly groups both market types into yards stacks
5. **Football.MD** - Complete documentation of NCAAF structure

### Frontend (All Complete)
1. **app.py** - NCAAF view updated:
   - Single-column layout (no completions column)
   - Receiver props display market type dynamically:
     - "REC YDS O 88.5" for reception yards
     - "RECEPTIONS O 6.5" for receptions
   - Same receiver can appear multiple times with different market types
   - NCAAF-specific refresh button (UPDATE NCAAF)

## How It Works

**NCAAF Stack Structure:**
```
QB: C.Williams (Ohio State)
Pass Yds: O 275.5 | EV: +2.8% | Books: 7

Correlated:
├─ M.Harrison Jr (WR1) - REC YDS O 88.5 | EV: +1.5% | Corr: 0.70 | Books: 6
├─ M.Harrison Jr (WR1) - RECEPTIONS O 6.5 | EV: +1.2% | Corr: 0.60 | Books: 5
└─ E.Egbuka (WR2) - REC YDS O 55.5 | EV: +0.8% | Corr: 0.55 | Books: 5
```

**Note:** Same player can have both Rec Yds and Receptions props in the same stack!

## Differences from NFL

| Feature | NFL | NCAAF |
|---------|-----|-------|
| QB Anchors | Pass Yards AND Pass Completions | Pass Yards ONLY |
| Display Layout | 2 columns (Yards / Completions) | 1 column (Yards with mixed receivers) |
| Receiver Markets | Rec Yds (with Pass Yds), Receptions (with Pass Comp) | Rec Yds AND Receptions (both with Pass Yds) |
| Splash Markets | All 4 markets available | Only 3 markets (no Pass Completions for QBs) |

## Refresh Button

The NCAAF view has a dedicated "UPDATE NCAAF" button that:
1. Runs `splash_scraper.py` with `sports=['ncaaf']`
2. Runs `odds_api.py` with `sports=['ncaaf']`
3. Automatically refreshes the page to show updated data

This allows you to update NCAAF props independently from NFL/MLB/WNBA.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start Flask server: `python Backend/app.py`
- [ ] Navigate to EV Opportunities → Parlays → NCAAF
- [ ] Verify single-column layout (no completions column)
- [ ] Verify receiver props show "REC YDS" or "RECEPTIONS" correctly
- [ ] Verify same receiver can appear twice with different markets
- [ ] Test "UPDATE NCAAF" button functionality
- [ ] Run full data pipeline:
  ```bash
  python Backend/data_scripts/splash_scraper.py ncaaf
  python Backend/data_scripts/odds_api.py ncaaf
  python Backend/data_scripts/create_report.py
  ```
- [ ] Verify NCAAF stacks appear in the interface

## Files Modified

### Backend Configuration
- `Backend/config.py` (lines 52-59)
- `Backend/data_scripts/splash_scraper.py` (line 37)
- `Backend/config/football_correlation_rules.py` (lines 44-50, 167-172)

### Documentation
- `Football.MD` (sections 1.1, 2.1, 5.2)

### Frontend
- `Backend/app.py` (ev_parlays_ncaaf_view function)
  - Updated receiver display logic to show market type
  - Removed completions column section
  - Single-column centered layout

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data:**
   ```bash
   python Backend/data_scripts/splash_scraper.py ncaaf
   python Backend/data_scripts/odds_api.py ncaaf
   ```

2. **Start Server:**
   ```bash
   python Backend/app.py
   ```

3. **Navigate to:**
   http://localhost:5001/ev-opportunities?view=parlays&sport=ncaaf

4. **Verify:**
   - QB Pass Yards props appear as anchors
   - Receivers show both Rec Yds and Receptions props
   - All correlations display correctly
   - EV calculations are accurate
